## 🤖 External API Integration

WhatToEat+ leverages several powerful external APIs to deliver its core functionality. Here's a detailed breakdown of how each API is integrated and utilized:

### Google Gemini API

**Purpose**: Powers the core receipt scanning and item extraction functionality.

**Integration Details**:
- **API Version**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (04-17)
- **Implementation**: Located in `server/routes.ts` in the `/api/receipts/analyze` endpoint
- **Input**: Receipt images (JPG, PNG) uploaded by users
- **Output**: Structured JSON data containing extracted items, prices, and categories
- **Features Utilized**:
  - Multimodal capabilities (both text and image processing)
  - Zero-shot learning for item recognition without explicit training
  - Context-aware understanding of receipt formats and structures

**Processing Flow**:
1. Image is uploaded and converted to base64 format
2. A specialized prompt instructs Gemini on how to process the receipt
3. The multimodal API analyzes text and layout to identify items, prices, and categories
4. Robust error handling and cleaning processes ensure valid JSON output
5. Additional fallback logic calculates missing values (e.g., derives GST if not explicitly found)

**API Optimization**:
- Custom prompting techniques to maximize accuracy
- Resilient parsing that handles various receipt formats
- Sophisticated error handling for edge cases
- JSON sanitation to ensure valid output despite API response variations

**Example Prompt Structure**:
```
Analyze this receipt and extract the items, GST (tax), and total in a simple JSON format.

Format each regular item as:
{"name": "Item Name", "description": "Details if any", "price": "$XX.XX", "category": "Food/Beverage/etc"}

Be sure to include GST/tax:
{"name": "GST", "description": "Goods and Services Tax", "price": "$X.XX", "category": "Tax"}

And the total:
{"name": "TOTAL", "description": "Total Payment", "price": "$XX.XX", "category": "Total"}

Return ONLY a properly formatted JSON array with no explanations.
```

### Spoonacular API

**Purpose**: Provides recipe recommendations, nutritional information, and advanced filtering capabilities.

**Integration Details**:
- **Implementation**: Located in `server/spoonacular.ts` with endpoints exposed in `server/routes.ts`
- **Primary Endpoints Used**:
  - `/recipes/complexSearch`: For filtered recipe search
  - `/recipes/random`: For discovering new recipes
  - `/recipes/{id}/information`: For detailed recipe information
  - `/recipes/{id}/nutritionWidget`: For nutritional breakdown

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. **Recipe Search with Advanced Filtering**:
   - Meal type filtering (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.)
   - Dietary preference filtering (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
   - Allergen exclusion
   - Cooking time filtering
   - Ingredient-based search
   
2. **Recipe Data Transformation**:
   - Custom mapping function (`mapSpoonacularRecipeToAppRecipe`) transforms the API response to match our application's data model
   - Image URL processing for optimal display
   - Ingredient list normalization

3. **Inventory-Based Recipe Matching**:
   - Intelligently matches user's inventory items with recipe ingredients
   - Implements fuzzy matching for ingredients (e.g., "tomatoes" will match "cherry tomatoes")
   - Calculates a "can make" score based on what percentage of ingredients the user has

4. **Nutritional Analysis**:
   - Calculates per-serving nutritional information
   - Provides macro and micronutrient breakdowns
   - Supports serving size adjustments

**Fallback Mechanisms**:
- Local database cache of recipes for when API limits are reached
- Graceful error handling for API outages
- Automatic retry logic for transient errors

**Example API Call Structure**:
```typescript
// Example of a complex recipe search with multiple parameters
export async function searchRecipes(
  query: string,
  diet?: string,
  mealType?: string,
  maxReadyTime?: number,
  intolerances?: string
): Promise<any> {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    apiKey: process.env.SPOONACULAR_API_KEY,
    query,
    number: '10',
    addRecipeInformation: 'true',
    fillIngredients: 'true',
    instructionsRequired: 'true'
  });

  if (diet) params.append('diet', diet);
  if (mealType) params.append('type', mealType);
  if (maxReadyTime) params.append('maxReadyTime', maxReadyTime.toString());
  if (intolerances) params.append('intolerances', intolerances);

  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch?${params.toString()}`
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    const error = await response.json();
    throw new Error(`Spoonacular API error: ${error.message || response.statusText}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

### DeepAI API

**Purpose**: Enhances receipt image quality for improved OCR and item extraction.

**Integration Details**:
- **Implementation**: Located in `server/deepai.ts`
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `/api/colorizer`: For enhancing black and white or faded receipts
  - `/api/torch-srgan`: For super-resolution to clarify blurry images

**Usage Flow**:
1. **Pre-processing Assessment**:
   - Before sending to Gemini API, receipt images are analyzed for quality issues
   - Low contrast, blurry, or faded receipts are identified for enhancement
   
2. **Image Enhancement Pipeline**:
   - **Color Enhancement**: Improves color balance and contrast
   - **Resolution Enhancement**: Increases clarity of text for better OCR results
   
3. **Integration with Receipt Processing**:
   - Enhanced images are then passed to Gemini API for item extraction
   - Fall back to original image if enhancement fails or times out

**Example Implementation**:
```typescript
export async function enhanceImage(imageUrl: string): Promise<string> {
  try {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('image', imageUrl);

    const response = await fetch('https://api.deepai.org/api/colorizer', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'api-key': process.env.DEEPAI_API_KEY,
      },
      body: formData,
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`DeepAI API error: ${response.statusText}`);
    }

    const result = await response.json();
    return result.output_url;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error enhancing image:', error);
    // Return original image URL as fallback
    return imageUrl;
  }
}
```
